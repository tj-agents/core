docker-health.ps1 — robust Docker pre-flight for the E2E suites.

WHY THIS EXISTS (do not weaken it):
`docker ps` answering is NOT proof Docker is healthy. A half-started / paused /
half-crashed Docker Desktop engine can keep an ALREADY-RUNNING container's port
forwarding alive (and keep answering `docker ps`, even `docker run hello-world`)
while host->container port forwarding for BRAND-NEW containers is dead. The E2E
suites don't notice until much later, at SQL fixture startup, where every
connection is accepted then reset ("pre-login handshake" / Win32 10053) and the
whole suite dies after a few minutes with ZERO scenarios executed.

A bare TCP connect is NOT enough either: the host-side `docker-proxy` completes
the TCP handshake locally even when forwarding of real bytes into the VM/container
is dead -- which is exactly SQL's "connection established, then pre-login handshake
aborted" mode. The only check that catches the bad state is the one the suites
actually depend on: create a FRESH container that publishes a port, then do a real
host->container DATA round-trip (an HTTP GET that returns bytes from inside the
container), and require it to be STABLE (the half-started engine flaps). That is
what this script does, then tears the probe down.

Exit 0 = healthy (safe to run E2E). Exit 1 = NOT healthy (do NOT run E2E; the
caller must stop and tell the user to fix Docker first).
