# Recent conversations

Requires Python 3.9+ and local transcript data for the selected harness. The packaged helper supports
Codex session metadata/response records and Claude project message records. It reads data only; it
never modifies profiles, launches a resume, or uploads history. Data in CODEX_HOME or CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
is an external input, not an unshipped helper dependency. Unsupported/empty records are not invented.

For Codex in the current directory:

```text
python -B "<skill-directory>/../../resources/machine/utility/scripts/history.py" recent --host codex
```

Use `--host claude` for Claude. Respect the requested harness; otherwise use the current host. Options
are `--count N`, `--cwd <directory>`, `--project <substring>`, `--all-projects`, and an explicit transcript
`--history-root <directory>` for a non-default data store. Quote paths and arguments for the calling shell.

Report the relevant session and its returned `resume` command. The newest session may be the current
one; distinguish it using the preview. Never guess an ID or use Claude's resume syntax for Codex.
An absent history directory fails clearly; an empty result means no supported matching conversations.
Only inspect history when the user requested it or authorized conversation enrichment. Never publish
raw history as a test fixture, report attachment or source file.
