r"""Reconcile the Claude plugin cache against the installed-plugin registry.

The registry is the truth. A cached version directory survives only when a live `installPath` names
it. Install and update already converge; removal never did, so every plugin rename left its
predecessor on disk permanently and nothing reconciled the two.

Unlike `skill_router.manifest_install_roots`, an unreadable registry is fatal here rather than a
fallback to walking the cache: "no live paths" must never be read as "everything is prunable".

The registry describes the next session, not the running one. A session that started before an update
still has hooks registered against the directory it resolved at startup, so `--pin` records that set and
every later pass treats a live session's pins as live too. Removal is therefore a liveness check, not a
side effect of update.

Codex is deliberately out of scope; see the sibling TECH_DEBT.md for the condition that changes that.
