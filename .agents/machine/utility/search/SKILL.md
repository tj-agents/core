# Search conversation history

Requires Python 3.9+ and the selected harness's local transcript data. Use the packaged read-only helper:

```text
python -B "<skill-directory>/../../resources/machine/scripts/history.py" search --host codex --pattern "<literal term>"
```

Select `--host claude` for Claude. Respect the named harness; otherwise use the current host. The default
search is literal and case-insensitive over user/assistant message text. `--regex` explicitly enables a
regular expression; `--show-lines` returns matching text only when the user needs it. Use `--project`,
`--cwd`, `--worktree <directory>`, `--count` or `--history-root` to narrow the request. `--worktree`
matches a recorded cwd or any tool-call input under that directory, across all projects. Quote arguments
for the calling shell.

The helper reads CODEX_HOME/sessions or CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects, with their native home defaults.
Those are user data locations, not executable dependencies. `--pattern` searches message text only;
`--worktree` also checks tool-call inputs, without emitting them. It does not write transcripts or
upload data. Missing directories fail clearly; no matches produce an empty list.
Summarize relevant hits and returned resume commands without dumping raw transcripts or publishing data.
