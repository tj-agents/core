# Linux port of the machine utilities

## Outcome and scope

Every machine utility and launcher in core works on Linux and Windows from one Python implementation.
Each skill keeps its name; its PowerShell script is replaced by a Python script in the same skill folder,
and the `.ps1` is deleted in the same PR that ports it. No parallel copies, no renames.

Out of scope: `.agents/sync-generated.ps1` and the repository's own test and install tooling, which are
repo maintenance rather than shipped behaviour and already run under pwsh on Linux.

## Authorization

The user authorized the whole port, one PR per step, including review and merge of each step
(2026-10-05/06). Each step ends merged before the next starts. Independent steps may run in parallel
on separate branches; each still lands as its own reviewed PR.

## Decisions and evidence

- Python, not pwsh: every hook already requires Python; pwsh would be an extra Linux dependency.
- Launchers open a tab, never a window. Detect the terminal we run inside and use its own new-tab command:
  `WT_SESSION` -> the existing `wt.exe --window 0 new-tab` path with its argument escaping; `TMUX` ->
  `tmux new-window`; `KITTY_WINDOW_ID` -> `kitty @ launch --type=tab`; `KONSOLE_DBUS_WINDOW` -> Konsole
  D-Bus `newSession`. Only with no terminal detected: open a new window and print a warning.
- On POSIX the environment changes travel inside the launched command
  (`sh -c 'cd "$1" && shift && exec "$@"' sh <dir> env -u ... AGENT_CLI_TAB_TITLE=<t> <exe> <args>`), because a
  tab is started by the terminal's own process. Launch detached with stdio on `/dev/null`. Never force or
  clear `TERM` on POSIX.
- The launched CLI always gets normal colour: `NO_COLOR` is in the cleared session environment.
- Kitty reaches its window over `listen_on unix:/tmp/kitty-{kitty_pid}` with
  `allow_remote_control socket-only`, in the user's dotfiles (tomjseery/dotfiles `a908963`). Only kitty
  processes started after that change have the socket.
- Catalog digests are generated output. PRs leave them uncommitted; CI's guard rejects them (step 1).
- On Windows with no detected terminal but `wt.exe` present, keep today's `wt.exe --window 0 new-tab`:
  still a tab, in the most recently used Windows Terminal window (user decision, 2026-10-06).
- The Windows Terminal handler runs only on Windows; `WT_SESSION` reaching WSL through `WSLENV` is ignored.

## Steps and acceptance criteria

Every step: tests pass, `pwsh .agents/sync-generated.ps1 -Check` passes, reviewed, merged; the PR lists
what still needs checking on Windows.

- [x] Shared library `.agents/machine/scripts/agent_cli.py`: environment scrub, Claude/Codex executable
  discovery, standards sync, lane lookup, Windows Terminal argument escaping (#106).
- [x] Kitty remote control in dotfiles, verified from a fresh kitty.
- [x] 1. CI guard rejects committed catalog digests, so concurrent PRs stop conflicting on them (#107).
- [x] 2. `open-claude` -> `scripts/open_claude.py` with the tab handlers; SKILL.md updated; `.ps1`
  deleted. Verified by opening a real tab in kitty on this machine (#108).
- [ ] 3. `handoff-claude` -> Python, then `handoff-codex` -> Python (`codex_marketplace_sync.ps1` with it).
  `engineering:handoff` works on Linux from here; verified with a real handoff.
- [ ] 4. Terminal start hooks: `claude-profile.ps1`/`claude_terminal_profile.py` and `codex-profile.ps1`
  refresh standards when `claude`/`codex` is typed, wired for bash as well as PowerShell (looking for
  both `python3` and `python`); `agent-cli.ps1` deleted.
- [ ] 5. `peer-cli` -> Python, listing and closing tabs in the detected terminal; `reap_orphans.py` stops
  assuming `wt.exe` is the parent.
- [x] 6. `clip` -> Python, using the platform clipboard (#125).
- [ ] 7. `persistent-workflow`'s `delivery-continuation.ps1` -> Python, verified on Linux.
- [x] 8. Tests that failed only on Linux pass: POSIX shell collapsed the Codex snapshot loader's escaped
  backslashes into NULs (now embedded as base64); a test plugin URL only git on Windows resolves; pwsh 7
  `Split` binding skipped the installer's ancestor reparse-point check (#160).
- [x] 9. CI runs the generated-tree checks and both Python suites on Linux as well as Windows
  (`verify-linux`, #162); it blocks a PR once the repository ruleset lists it as a required check,
  which awaits the user's decision after a few green runs.
- [ ] 10. Shipped instructions follow `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md`'s Supported platforms: no shipped Markdown
  under `.agents/`, `.claude/` or `.codex/` tells an agent to run bare `python`, `powershell.exe`, `pwsh`
  or `wt.exe` without naming the platform (including the session exit in `merge` Step 5 and in
  `merge-docs`' Report), every unported skill says it is Windows-only, and the PowerShell test suite of
  each shipped script retires with that script's port or gains a Linux counterpart.

## Current progress

Shared library merged (#106, after the interim path fix #105). Kitty configured. Steps merged: 1 (#107),
2 `open-claude` (#108), 3a `handoff-claude` (#120, a real handoff tab verified on this machine), 6 `clip`
(#125), 8 Linux-only test failures (#160), 9 Linux CI (#162). #166 makes the cross-platform direction a written
convention in `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md`, labels `peer-cli` Windows-only, and adds step 10 for the rest of the
shipped instructions. Step 3b `handoff-codex` in review as #137.

## Next Steps

Land 3b; then 5 (`peer-cli`, `close` and `finish` first, so the `merge` skill's Step 5 session exit
works on Linux) and 4 (terminal start hooks, deleting `agent-cli.ps1`); then 7 and 10. After `verify-linux`
has had a few green runs, ask the user whether the repository ruleset should require it.
